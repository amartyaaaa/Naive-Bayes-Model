# Naive-Bayes-Model
In Naive Bayes Model, classification is based on comparing probabilities. If 2 categories of data exists and a new datapoint is introduced and we need to decide which category it belongs to, it is done by finding the probability of the datapoint being in each of thee category and then the probability for which it is highes the datapoint is classified to that category. It is applicable for more than 2 categories also.
